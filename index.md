- With the rising number of car break-ins here in San Francisco, I decided to do some data exploration using the reported crimes data given by DataSF
  
- The dataset originally had 700k+ reported crimes, in order to suit the needs of this project, I had to find a way to clean the data up to only show what i needed. I ended up using the pandas library in python in order to filter out unnessecary data from the dataset.
  
- The Following code is what i used to filter out the data in python.
  
```break
#reads csv file
Police_Report_df = pd.read_csv("Police_Report.csv")

#filters the csv file to Larceny Theft with Subcategory of Larceny from vehicle. then sets it to Police_Report_df
condition = (Police_Report_df['Incident Category'] == 'Larceny Theft') & (Police_Report_df['Incident Subcategory'] == 'Larceny - From Vehicle')
Police_Report_df = Police_Report_df[condition]
```

- With that out of the way, I was curious as to which neighbourhoods in SF have the most number of Car breakins. In order to Figure that out, I used the code below.


```break
#Analysis by Neighborhood
def Analysis_by_Neighborhood(data):
    # Count the number of incidents for each neighborhood
    neighborhood_counts = Police_Report_df['Analysis Neighborhood'].value_counts()

    # Create a bar plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))  # Adjust the figure size as needed
    neighborhood_counts.plot(kind='bar', color='lightcoral')
    plt.title('Car Break-ins by Neighbourhood')
    plt.xlabel('Neighborhood')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.xticks(rotation=90)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
    plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.show()
```

- This code visualized the data which resulted into this graph.
